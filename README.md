# Keras-LSTM-Sentiment-Classification
Using Deep Learning Neural Networks to classify reviews of movie dataset to Positive and Negative Sentiment.

Requirements -
1. Python 3
2. Google word vectors (https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/)
3. Theano/Tensorflow (I have created model using Theano)
4. Keras (As a wrapper around Theano/Tensoflow)

Here we have used LSTM that are best RNN for doing text classification. Its a binary class problem i.e positive and Negative sentiment.
I was able to get 90% accuracy. But we can improve it more my creating more complex model and tuning the hyper parameters.

Happy Learning.
